Surreal
-------

#### Introduction

This is an interactive world written in C++ and OpenGL. It was my final project for my graphics course.

I wanted to create a surrealist world inspired by the artworks of [Georgio De Chirico](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_de_Chirico) and [Yves Tanguy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Tanguy). To create the atmosphere of these proto-surrealist paintings, I had to create a world that is both unsettling and strangely serene. To do that, I focused on three elements that are common to all the paintings:

* Vast open space
* Harsh Mediterranean sunlight and harsh shadows
* Strange juxaposition of objects

The resulting world features a vast space to walk around in, floating spheres, a day/night cycle, and a bleeding venus.

#### Features

* Procedurally generated world
* Shadows done with shadow mapping
* Day/night cycle
* Particle system
* Simple 3D collision detection
